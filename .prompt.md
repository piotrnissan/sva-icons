I have icon set in the `sva-icons` folder.
I want to be able to use those icons in my css framework, in html, javasctipt, in web components and react components.
I want to be able to add new icons or remove them from the set easily.
There should be possibility to tag individual icons, so it will be easier to find them later.
I would like to create system similar to [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/). So I can use them like here - https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide
What are my options to achieve this?
