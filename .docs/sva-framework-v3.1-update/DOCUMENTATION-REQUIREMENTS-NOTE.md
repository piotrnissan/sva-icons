# SVA Framework v3.1+ Documentation Requirements
## Updated Context and Priorities

**Date**: July 2, 2025  
**Context**: First Integration Phase - No Migration Needed

---

## üéØ **Key Context**

**Important**: No one is currently using the SVA Icon system in production. The SVA Framework team is working on the **first integration**. This means:

- ‚ùå **No migration guides needed** - no existing users to migrate
- ‚ùå **No breaking change documentation** - no existing implementations to break
- ‚úÖ **Focus on getting it right the first time** - this is essentially greenfield
- ‚úÖ **Focus on comprehensive setup guides** - help the first users succeed

---

## üìö **Documentation Priorities**

### **High Priority - First Users**
1. **Complete setup guides** for all environments (browser, Vite, Webpack, etc.)
2. **Best practices** for auto-registration
3. **API reference** for class-based and function-based icons
4. **Performance considerations** and optimization
5. **Troubleshooting guides** for common setup issues

### **Medium Priority - Framework Integration**
1. **Framework-specific guides** (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
2. **Bundle optimization** strategies
3. **Advanced configuration** options
4. **Testing strategies** for icon implementations

### **Low Priority - Future Considerations**
1. **Upgrade paths** (for future versions only)
2. **Migration tools** (not needed now)
3. **Legacy support** (not applicable)

## ‚úÖ **Completed Auto-Registration System**

The auto-registration system is now **fully working** with these features:

### **DOM Scanning (Zero Config)**
```javascript
// Automatically finds and registers icons from HTML classes
await initializeClassBasedIcons({
    scanDOM: true,
    prefix: 'sva-icon-'
});
```

### **Bundle Registration**
```javascript
// Register predefined bundles of related icons
await initializeClassBasedIcons({
    registerBundles: ['ui-essentials', 'automotive-core'],
    prefix: 'sva-icon-'
});
```

### **Available Bundles**
- `ui-essentials`: plus, minus, settings, cross, tick, search, filter, edit
- `automotive-core`: car, battery, charging, alert, speed, fuel-type, engine-power
- `navigation`: arrow-up, arrow-down, arrow-left, arrow-right, directions, map-view
- `communication`: phone, email, chat, message, contact-phone, contact-email
- `media`: play, pause, volume, camera, video, gallery
- `commerce`: price, payment, calculator-1, offers, trade-in

### **Dynamic Content Support**
- ‚úÖ Mutation observer watches for dynamically added icons
- ‚úÖ Automatic registration of new icons as they appear
- ‚úÖ Perfect for SPAs and dynamic applications

## üöÄ **Ready for Next SVA Framework v3.1+ Requirements**

The auto-registration system is complete and tested. Time to move on to other v3.1+ requirements while keeping documentation updates focused on **first-time users** rather than migration scenarios.

*This note serves as a reminder that we're in a first-integration phase, not a migration phase.*
