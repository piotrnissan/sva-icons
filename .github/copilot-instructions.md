I'm using PowerShell, so please use PowerShell syntax in your responses.
Also `&&` is not a valid operator in PowerShell, so please use `;` to separate commands instead.
I'm using Live Preview, so I can see pages at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`.
Any test files should be placed in the `.tests` directory.
If you are creating any docs, please place them in the `.docs` directory.
